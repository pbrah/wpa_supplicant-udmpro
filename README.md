# wpa_supplicant for UDM and UDM Pro
## UPDATE 03.07.2020
For v1.6.3 and newer you need to run your container with podman instead which changes the command slightly.  Below is an example of how to do this.  Keep in mind that currently there is an alias for docker to point to the podman executable on the UDM Pro since it was made to be a drop in replacement for docker commands.  I would still run this with the podman executable just in case that alias goes away in the future.
```
podman run --privileged --network=host --name=wpa_supplicant-udmpro -v /mnt/data/docker/wpa_supplicant/:/etc/wpa_supplicant/conf/ --log-driver=json-file --restart unless-stopped -d -ti pbrah/wpa_supplicant-udmpro:v1.0 -Dwired -ieth8 -c/etc/wpa_supplicant/conf/wpa_supplicant.conf
```

## overview
This guide has primarily been written for authenticating to AT&T U-Verse using wpa_supplicant on a UDM Pro.  It is assumed that you've already retrieved your certificates from a modem supplied by AT&T.  If you have not, you can purchase a used modem on ebay, such as the NVG589 and then root it to get the certificates.  I had success using the following guide.

Before moving on to the next section, make sure you've copied your root certificate into the CA_*.pem file per the instructions of the 802.1x Credential Extraction Tool (mfg_dat_decode).

## running the docker image
1.  scp your certs and wpa_supplicant.conf to the UDM Pro

```
scp -r *.pem root@192.168.1.1:/tmp/
root@192.168.1.1's password:
CA_001E46-xxxx.pem                                                          100% 3926     3.8KB/s   00:00
Client_001E46-xxxx.pem                                                      100% 1119     1.1KB/s   00:00
PrivateKey_PKCS1_001E46-xxxx.pem                                            100%  887     0.9KB/s   00:00

scp -r wpa_supplicant.conf root@192.168.1.1:/tmp/
wpa_supplicant.conf                                                         100%  680     0.7KB/s   00:00
```

2. ssh to the UDM Pro, create a directory for the certs and wpa_supplicant.conf in the docker directory then copy the files over.

```
mkdir /mnt/data/docker/wpa_supplicant/
cp -arfv /tmp/*pem /tmp/wpa_supplicant.conf /mnt/data/docker/wpa_supplicant/
```

3. Update the wpa_supplicant.conf to reflect the correct paths for our container.  **Do not run these more than once or you will end up with incorrect paths.**

```
sed -i 's,ca_cert=",ca_cert="/etc/wpa_supplicant/conf/,g' /mnt/data/docker/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
sed -i 's,client_cert=",client_cert="/etc/wpa_supplicant/conf/,g' /mnt/data/docker/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
sed -i 's,private_key=",private_key="/etc/wpa_supplicant/conf/,g' /mnt/data/docker/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
```

After running the sed commands, verify your paths in wpa_supplicant.conf look something like this:
```
# cat wpa_supplicant.conf

        client_cert="/etc/wpa_supplicant/conf/Client_001E46-xxxxxx.pem"
        eap=TLS
        eapol_flags=0
        identity="10:05:B1:xx:xx:xx" # Internet (ONT) interface MAC address must match this value

        phase1="allow_canned_success=1"
        private_key="/etc/wpa_supplicant/conf/PrivateKey_PKCS1_001E46-xxxxxx.pem"
}
# WARNING! Missing AAA server root CA! Add AAA server root CA to CA_001E46-xxxxxx.pem
#
```

4. Pull the docker image while you have an internet connection on the UDM Pro.  This step is optional if you plan on running step 5 while you have an internet connection.

```
docker pull pbrah/wpa_supplicant-udmpro:v1.0
```

5. Run the wpa_supplicant docker container, the docker run command below assumes you are using port 9 or eth8 for your wan.  If not, adjust accordingly.

```
docker run --privileged --network=host --name=wpa_supplicant-udmpro -v /mnt/data/docker/wpa_supplicant/:/etc/wpa_supplicant/conf/ --log-driver=json-file --restart unless-stopped -d -ti pbrah/wpa_supplicant-udmpro:v1.0 -Dwired -ieth8 -c/etc/wpa_supplicant/conf/wpa_supplicant.conf
```

## troubleshooting
If you are having issues connecting after starting your docker container, the first thing you should do is check your docker container logs.
```
docker logs -f wpa_supplicant-udmpro
```

From a recent case I assisted in troubleshooting, the user saw the following in their logs.  The was due to their wpa_supplicant.conf having incorrect paths to the certificates.  Refer to my example in the instructions to ensure yours are pointing to the correct location.
```

```



## create your own docker image
For anyone that wants to create their own docker image, I've provided brief instructions below.

1. grab docker/Dockerfile and upload it to /root/docker/ on the UDM Pro
2. Build image
```
cd /root/docker/
docker build --network=host -t pbrah/wpa_supplicant-udmpro:v1.0 .
```

### UDM non-pro
This works with the standard UDM as of OS 1.7.0 with a few adjustments to the podman run command:

```
podman run --privileged --network=host --name=wpa_supplicant-udmpro -v /mnt/data/docker/wpa_supplicant/:/etc/wpa_supplicant/conf/ --log-driver=k8s-file --restart always -d -ti pbrah/wpa_supplicant-udmpro:v1.0 -Dwired -ieth4 -c/etc/wpa_supplicant/conf/wpa_supplicant.conf
```
